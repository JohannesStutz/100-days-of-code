# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Johannes Stutz

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 30, Saturday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a [Python website blocker](https://github.com/JohannesStutz/python-website-blocker) / productivity script. Have a prototype running. Ideas for many features, i.e., scheduling and Pomodoro. Not sure if Python is the right tool, a standalone tool or browser extension would be better.

### R1D2
Didn't have much time for coding today. Continued with [Python website blocker](https://github.com/JohannesStutz/python-website-blocker) and added a Pomodoro timer. Next: feature for scheduling or blocking websites for a specific length of time. Also: figure out how to make an installable package.

### R1D3
- Decided to try the website blocker project with [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev). A tool that lets you develop software in Jupyter notebooks. It can automatically create pip packages and a documentation website: https://johannesstutz.github.io/beproductive/
- GitHub link: [Be Productive](https://github.com/JohannesStutz/beproductive)
- Added support for Linux (and probably MacOS, can't test it)
- Had trouble using git. Took over half an hour to fix a merge conflict caused by A SINGLE LINE. Need to learn git basics!
