# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Johannes Stutz

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 30, Saturday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a [Python website blocker](https://github.com/JohannesStutz/python-website-blocker) / productivity script. Have a prototype running. Ideas for many features, i.e., scheduling and Pomodoro. Not sure if Python is the right tool, a standalone tool or browser extension would be better.

### R1D2
Didn't have much time for coding today. Continued with [Python website blocker](https://github.com/JohannesStutz/python-website-blocker) and added a Pomodoro timer. Next: feature for scheduling or blocking websites for a specific length of time. Also: figure out how to make an installable package.
